1
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:15,679
Emily, something strange happened today.

2
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:19,359
>> Really? What happened?

3
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:23,039
>> I sent a text to my classmate. I wrote,

4
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:28,160
"I will send you a message later."

5
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:31,359
He texted back, "Oh, are you new here?"

6
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:34,160
I was so surprised.

7
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:37,760
How did he know I am new?

8
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:40,320
>> Oh, I think I understand.

9
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:44,320
That's kind of funny.

10
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:46,879
>> Wait, you understand it? Why did he

11
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,520
think I am new?

12
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:54,480
>> Because native speakers don't usually

13
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:57,480
say send a message. They usually say

14
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,480
text.

15
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:05,199
Really? But my textbook says send a

16
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:08,640
message is correct.

17
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:11,680
>> The textbook is right. It's not wrong.

18
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:14,960
But in real life, in everyday talk,

19
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,600
people just say text.

20
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:20,720
>> So if I want to sound more natural, I

21
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:23,920
should say, I'll text you.

22
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:27,040
>> Exactly. I'll text you sounds like

23
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:29,040
normal natural English.

24
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,799
>> Ah,

25
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,600
now I see it.

26
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:37,439
>> Phone English has many small things like

27
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:39,920
this. A lot of learners study for years

28
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,600
and still don't know them.

29
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,840
>> Then

30
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,600
I really need to learn more phone

31
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,880
English.

32
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:51,439
>> Don't worry. Today you can learn with my

33
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,920
day. I'll tell you about my day

34
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:56,880
yesterday with my phone.

35
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:59,840
>> Your day with your phone?

36
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:03,520
>> Yes. From morning to night. I'll show

37
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:07,439
you how I use it.

38
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:09,599
Every little thing, every little word.

39
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:12,239
You can learn English through stories

40
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:15,760
like this.

41
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:19,239
>> Okay, let's go. I'm ready. Slow English

42
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,239
practice time.

43
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:27,200
Every morning I use my phone as my alarm

44
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:31,360
clock. Beep beep. It wakes me up.

45
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:36,440
>> You use your phone as an alarm clock?

46
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,440
>> Yes. Many people do that now.

47
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:46,040
The alarm rings and I press snooze.

48
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,040
>> Snooze.

49
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:55,040
Snooze means I sleep a few more minutes.

50
00:02:50,640 --> 00:03:01,200
Maybe five minutes, maybe 10.

51
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:05,000
>> Oh, so snooze means sleep a little more.

52
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,000
Just a short time.

53
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:11,760
>> Exactly.

54
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:14,400
I press snooze, then I wake up again.

55
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:17,280
>> If I press snooze, I will sleep for two

56
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,280
more hours.

57
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:25,440
That's dangerous.

58
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:29,000
After the alarm, I look at my phone and

59
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,000
check my notifications.

60
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:35,120
>> Notifications?

61
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:39,040
>> Yes. Notifications are the little

62
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:42,879
messages on the screen.

63
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:48,159
They tell me new things like new emails,

64
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:52,080
new texts, news and so on.

65
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:55,760
>> Ah, so notification means hey something

66
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:58,080
new for you. I can say I have 10

67
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:03,000
notifications this morning.

68
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:03,000
>> Perfect. That's a great sentence.

69
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:10,159
So, in the morning, your phone is your

70
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:13,159
alarm, your snooze button, and your

71
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:13,159
notifications,

72
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:21,519
right? My day starts with my phone.

73
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:24,479
After my alarm, I go to the kitchen. I

74
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:27,880
make breakfast. And of course, I take my

75
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:27,880
phone with me.

76
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,520
Do you really need your phone for

77
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:39,800
breakfast?

78
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:39,800
>> Yes. While I eat, I look at my phone.

79
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:46,120
>> I open the news app.

80
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,120
>> The news.

81
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:52,000
>> Not a P. We just say app.

82
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:56,639
>> Oh, app.

83
00:04:52,000 --> 00:05:00,320
>> Yes. like map app, music app, weather

84
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:02,080
app. Just say app.

85
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,720
>> App.

86
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:08,240
>> Good. Say it one more time.

87
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:12,639
>> App. App.

88
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:14,320
>> Perfect. So, I open the news app and

89
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,919
read the headlines.

90
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,560
>> Headlines.

91
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:21,120
What are headlines?

92
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:25,280
>> Headlines are the big news titles you

93
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:28,400
see first. For example, big storm today

94
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:32,320
or new movie is number one.

95
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:34,560
>> Ah, so a headline is a short news title.

96
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:38,479
>> Exactly.

97
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:40,639
>> And after that I check my group chat.

98
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:45,919
>> Your friends text you in the morning.

99
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:48,560
>> Uh, no, they text at night, but I read

100
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:51,039
everything in the morning.

101
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:53,440
>> That's a lot to read.

102
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:56,080
So, you open the news app, read the

103
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:58,960
headlines, and then check your group

104
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:02,960
chat.

105
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:07,199
>> Yes, that is my breakfast with my phone.

106
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:08,960
And remember, app not a easy English

107
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:13,039
snack.

108
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:16,400
>> Look, Emily, I just got a text with only

109
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:18,479
emojis. Just a smiley face and a slice

110
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:22,080
of pizza.

111
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:24,240
>> That's easy. It means let's eat pizza

112
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:28,880
and be happy.

113
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:30,479
>> True. Emojis are like a new language.

114
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,280
>> Yeah.

115
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:36,600
Sometimes I think I speak emoji better

116
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,600
than English.

117
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:43,880
After breakfast, I leave home. I put on

118
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,880
my headphones.

119
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,520
>> Headphones? Let me guess. for music,

120
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:53,759
right?

121
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:55,600
>> Yes. I open my music app. I love my

122
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:59,599
music app in the morning.

123
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:02,560
>> Music app. I have one, too, but I often

124
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:05,880
forget to open it. I just sit on the bus

125
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,880
in silence.

126
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:13,360
>> You need music in the morning.

127
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:15,919
Sometimes I listen to songs. Sometimes I

128
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:19,360
listen to an audio book.

129
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:21,680
>> Audio book. You mean like a book that

130
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:26,919
talks to you?

131
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,919
>> Exactly. A book you can listen to.

132
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:35,080
>> I listen to audiobooks when I'm on the

133
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:35,080
bus or on the train.

134
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:41,759
>> That's cool.

135
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:45,080
My books just sit on the shelf. I never

136
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,080
read them.

137
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:52,639
Oh, look. I see two missed calls.

138
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:56,120
>> Missed calls? So, your phone rang and

139
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,120
you didn't answer.

140
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:02,560
>> Yes. Missed calls are calls you don't

141
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:05,879
answer. If I don't want pickup, I get a

142
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,879
missed call.

143
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:12,479
>> Got it.

144
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:15,759
So if I'm sleeping and my mom calls,

145
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:19,919
later I see five missed calls.

146
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:23,039
>> Exactly. And later I call back.

147
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:25,599
>> Call back after missed calls. That one

148
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:27,280
is easy.

149
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,680
>> Right.

150
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:33,039
So, on the way to school, I use my

151
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:36,399
headphones, my music app or audio book,

152
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:40,320
and I also check my missed calls.

153
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:44,159
When I'm in class, I don't use my phone.

154
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:47,159
I put it away. My bag is closed. Phone

155
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,159
inside.

156
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:53,320
>> Put it away. So, you hide it in your

157
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,320
bag.

158
00:08:53,920 --> 00:09:02,360
>> Yes, I put it away. and don't look at

159
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:02,360
it. I also turn on do not disturb.

160
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:13,800
>> Do not disturb. That means no calls, no

161
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,800
texts, right?

162
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,720
>> Yes.

163
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:22,000
When I turn on do not disturb, I don't

164
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,839
get calls. I don't get texts. I don't

165
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:28,160
hear sounds.

166
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:31,120
Oh, so do not disturb makes the phone

167
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:34,000
quiet.

168
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:37,839
Very quiet.

169
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,080
>> Exactly. Do not disturb equals total

170
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:44,920
silence.

171
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,920
And I stop the vibration, too.

172
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:51,360
>> Vibration?

173
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:56,320
You mean when the phone shakes?

174
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:58,160
>> Yes. the little buzz. Vibration is the

175
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:02,080
shake.

176
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:05,720
>> So, no ring, no vibration. The phone is

177
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:05,720
completely quiet,

178
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:15,680
>> right? No sound, no vibration.

179
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:19,200
So, in class, I put my phone away, I

180
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:21,040
turn on do not disturb, and I stop

181
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:25,360
vibration.

182
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:29,040
The teacher is happy. At lunchtime, I go

183
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:35,640
to the cafeteria. To get in, I scan the

184
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:35,640
QR code on my phone. Beep. Door open.

185
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,880
>> QR code. What is that?

186
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:48,839
>> A QR code is the little black and white

187
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,839
square you scan.

188
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:57,800
Oh, QR code. I see.

189
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:57,800
>> Then I walk into the cafeteria.

190
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:05,760
>> Cafeteria. Oh, you mean the big room at

191
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:09,519
school where students eat?

192
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:13,720
>> Yes, exactly. The cafeteria is the place

193
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:13,720
where many students eat.

194
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:22,320
Then I open the cafeteria app and order

195
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:25,839
my lunch. No waiting in a long line.

196
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:28,800
>> So you order on the app and later you

197
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:32,000
just pick it up.

198
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:35,000
>> Yes. My phone tells me when my food is

199
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
ready.

200
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:41,040
Sometimes my friends come too. We sit,

201
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:43,839
talk, and wait for our names on the

202
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,839
screen.

203
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:52,640
So, your phone does everything.

204
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:57,680
Door, order, pickup.

205
00:11:52,640 --> 00:12:01,040
>> And before we eat, we take a selfie.

206
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:02,720
>> Oh, I always said take a picture of

207
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:07,200
myself.

208
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:09,440
>> That is okay. But we usually just say

209
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:12,720
selfie.

210
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:16,079
>> Selfie. Short and easy.

211
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:18,000
>> Exactly. We always take a selfie before

212
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:21,519
we start to eat.

213
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,399
>> First selfie, then food. That's the

214
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:25,120
rule.

215
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:27,920
>> English snack.

216
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,680
John, have you ever heard of a pocket

217
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:36,200
call?

218
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:36,200
>> A pocket call? Like call your pocket?

219
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,680
>> No.

220
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:44,240
A pocket call is when your phone calls

221
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:47,480
someone by mistake from your pocket or

222
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,480
your bag.

223
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:54,480
>> Ah, I know that.

224
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:58,279
I once pocket called my teacher.

225
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,279
It was so embarrassing.

226
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:04,720
>> After lunch, I walk to the library.

227
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,040
My phone comes with me because I use it

228
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:10,040
there, too.

229
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,040
>> Really?

230
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:18,160
You need your phone even in the library?

231
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:23,880
>> Yes. If I want to borrow a book, I open

232
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:23,880
the library app and scan the QR code.

233
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:30,000
>> Scan, like take a picture.

234
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:33,920
>> Almost.

235
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,320
A scan is like a photo but for a code.

236
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:39,320
The phone reads the code and gets the

237
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,320
information.

238
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:49,680
Ah, scan the code. I understand.

239
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:53,920
>> Yes. Now I can borrow the book. Then I

240
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:56,160
sit down at a table. Time to study. Shh.

241
00:13:53,920 --> 00:14:00,399
This is the library.

242
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:02,000
>> Okay, I will be quiet.

243
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:05,680
>> Wait,

244
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,079
why are you looking at your phone again?

245
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:10,800
I'm using flashcards.

246
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:13,360
Flash cards are small cards with a word

247
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:15,199
or picture on them. They help me

248
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:18,560
remember words.

249
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:21,279
>> Ah, flash cards on your phone.

250
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:24,279
>> Yes, a flashc card app. It is very

251
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:24,279
simple.

252
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:32,399
>> Cool. And what is that on the video?

253
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:34,800
>> Those are subtitles.

254
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:37,519
Subtitles are the words at the bottom of

255
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:40,519
the video. They help me read while I

256
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:40,519
listen.

257
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:47,760
Oh, I see words at the bottom.

258
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:53,079
Subtitles. Nice.

259
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:53,079
And my phone is on do not disturb again.

260
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:04,399
After the library, I walk home.

261
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:07,399
I open my phone and check the weather

262
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,399
app.

263
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:15,240
>> Weather app? You mean it tells you if it

264
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,240
will rain or be sunny?

265
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:23,279
>> Yes.

266
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:26,639
It shows sun, rain, clouds, snow. Today

267
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:29,760
it says sunny.

268
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:32,240
>> So no umbrella.

269
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,240
Huh?

270
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:39,680
Good news,

271
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:42,880
>> right? The weather app saves me. If it

272
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:45,839
says rain, I take my umbrella. If it

273
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:50,000
says sun, I don't need it.

274
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:53,519
>> Weather app. Umbrella. Sunny.

275
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,680
I can say, "My weather app says rainy,

276
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:59,120
so I take an umbrella."

277
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:01,839
>> Perfect sentence. Sometimes if I want to

278
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:06,079
visit a friend, I open the map app with

279
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:10,880
GPS. It shows me the way step by step.

280
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:16,360
>> Oh, the map app with GPS. So I can say,

281
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:16,360
I use GPS to go to my friend's house.

282
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:26,040
>> Exactly. Weather app and map app with

283
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:26,040
GPS. Two apps that make life easier.

284
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:34,959
English snack again. Do you know the

285
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:37,440
phrase call it a day, John?

286
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:42,800
Is it about making a phone call?

287
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:45,920
>> No. Call it a day means stop working.

288
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:52,480
Finish for today.

289
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:54,880
>> Oh, so no more study. We call it a day.

290
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:58,399
That's easy.

291
00:16:54,880 --> 00:17:03,240
At home, I sit on the sofa. I open a

292
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:03,240
video app and I stream a show.

293
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:13,199
>> Stream? You mean watch online?

294
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:15,439
>> Yes, stream means watch online, not

295
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:20,400
download.

296
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:24,120
>> Ah, I also stream shows, but sometimes I

297
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,120
watch without subtitles.

298
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:32,919
Subtitles help a lot. They are the words

299
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,919
at the bottom of the screen.

300
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:39,280
>> Okay. Subtitles.

301
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:41,600
So I can say I stream a movie with

302
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:44,480
subtitles.

303
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:46,400
>> Exactly. That is a very natural

304
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:51,520
sentence.

305
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:55,120
>> Subtitles stream. Now I understand.

306
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:58,559
In the evening, I make a few calls. I

307
00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:00,480
call my mom and I call my friend.

308
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:04,720
>> Do you call with your phone?

309
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:07,600
>> Careful. We say call on my phone or use

310
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,480
my phone to call, not call with my

311
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,200
phone.

312
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:13,679
>> Oh, I always said call with my phone.

313
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:16,799
>> Many learners do, but it sounds strange

314
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:19,360
to native speakers. It's better to say I

315
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:22,960
call on my phone.

316
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:25,760
>> Okay. I call on my phone.

317
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:27,360
I call on my phone. I will practice

318
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:32,080
that.

319
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:35,039
>> Great. Now it sounds natural.

320
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:36,880
>> Sometimes when people don't answer, I

321
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:39,360
leave a voicemail.

322
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,559
>> Voicemail. That is a message with your

323
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:44,240
voice.

324
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:47,360
>> Exactly. Like a voice note. You speak

325
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,799
and the other person listens later.

326
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:52,640
>> Okay.

327
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:54,480
I can say, "Sorry, I missed your call. I

328
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:58,160
left a voicemail."

329
00:18:54,480 --> 00:19:00,559
>> Perfect sentence. Before bed, I set my

330
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:03,280
alarm on my phone. Beep beep for

331
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:06,160
tomorrow morning.

332
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:09,400
>> Good idea. So, your phone will wake you

333
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,400
up again?

334
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:19,120
>> Then I put my phone on do not disturb,

335
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:19,120
brush my teeth, and get ready for sleep.

336
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:27,720
Do not disturb again. No calls, no

337
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:27,720
sounds. Perfect for night.

338
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:35,440
>> Exactly.

339
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:38,640
Then I close my eyes and sleep.

340
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:41,200
>> So your whole day is with your phone.

341
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,720
From the alarm in the morning to the

342
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:47,360
alarm at night.

343
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:50,480
>> That's right. My day with my phone. So,

344
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:54,720
John, think about one full day with my

345
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:56,480
phone. In the morning, alarm, snooze,

346
00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:00,240
notifications,

347
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:01,840
then breakfast, news app, headlines,

348
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:05,360
group chat.

349
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:09,919
>> On the way to school, headphones, music

350
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:12,160
app, audio book, missed calls, and call

351
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:15,840
back

352
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:20,679
>> in class. Put it away. Do not disturb.

353
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:20,679
No vibration, total silence.

354
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:29,280
>> At lunch, cafeteria. Scan the QR code.

355
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:31,840
Cafeteria app. Order food. Selfie.

356
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:34,880
Pocket call

357
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:38,320
>> in the library. Scan to borrow.

358
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:41,840
Flashcards to study, subtitles to read,

359
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:47,200
and do not disturb to stay focused.

360
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:52,720
>> Walking home. Weather app. Sun or rain,

361
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:56,400
umbrella, and map app with GPS.

362
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:59,600
>> In the evening, stream a show, watch

363
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:02,559
with subtitles.

364
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:05,360
>> At night, make calls, leave a voicemail

365
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:09,120
if they don't answer, set the alarm, do

366
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:13,520
not disturb, then sleep.

367
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:16,400
>> My phone never rests. True. But every

368
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:18,240
time you use it, you also learn small

369
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,080
English words.

370
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:23,440
>> Exactly.

371
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:25,600
Many learners study for years and still

372
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,919
make these mistakes.

373
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:32,559
>> But not you now, John.

374
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:36,000
>> Right now I know. Next time I will text

375
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:39,440
you, not send you a message.

376
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:43,880
>> Yes, that's the idea. a day with my

377
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,880
phone and a lot of English

378
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:50,559
>> and a lot of slow English practice

379
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:53,520
>> and we learn English through stories

380
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,520
every day.
